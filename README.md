The unit tests are written in Jasmine and launched through a Karma launcher, that uses the ```karma.conf.js``` config file.
You can run the issue ```grunt test```. Also, they are run when building the release.
To run unit test on multiple browser edit ```karma.conf.js```.
#### End to End
E2E tests are run using Protractor, a library that leverages WebDriverJs to run tests on angular. The config file is ```protractor.conf.js```
All the Unit test live in the ```e2e``` folder.
